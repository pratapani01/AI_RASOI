2. Ingredients Needed:

* **For the Rice:**
    * 1 cup Basmati rice, soaked for 30 minutes
    * 2 cups water
    * 1 tsp ghee (clarified butter) or olive oil
    * 1 small onion, finely chopped
    * 2 cloves garlic, minced
    * 1 inch ginger, minced
    * 1/2 tsp turmeric powder
    * 1/4 tsp saffron strands (optional, for color and aroma)
    * Salt to taste
* **For the Vegetables:**
    * 1 cup mixed vegetables (carrots, peas, beans, cauliflower, potatoes – cut into small pieces)
    * 1/2 cup chopped tomatoes
    * 1/4 cup chopped cilantro
    * 1 green chili, finely chopped (adjust to your spice preference)
    * 1 tsp biryani masala (adjust to your spice preference)
    * 1/2 tsp garam masala
    * 1/4 tsp red chili powder (adjust to your spice preference)
    * 1/4 tsp cumin powder
    * 1/4 tsp coriander powder

3. Step-by-Step Instructions:

1. **Prepare the Vegetables:** Heat a little ghee/oil in a pan. Add onions and sauté until golden. Add ginger-garlic paste and sauté for a minute. Then, add the mixed vegetables and sauté for 5-7 minutes. Add tomatoes, green chilies, turmeric powder, biryani masala, garam masala, red chili powder, cumin powder, and coriander powder. Mix well and cook until the vegetables are tender-crisp (about 5-7 minutes). 
2. **Cook the Rice:** In a separate pan, heat ghee/oil. Add the chopped onions and sauté until golden. Add saffron strands (if using) and sauté for a few seconds. Add the soaked rice and sauté for 2 minutes. Add water, salt, and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer until the rice is cooked but still firm (around 12-15 minutes).
3. **Assemble the Biryani:**  Gently mix the cooked vegetables with the cooked rice.  You can layer them in a pot for a more traditional presentation, but mixing is fine for a healthier, quicker version. Garnish with fresh cilantro.

4. Estimated Calories: Approximately 350-400 calories per serving (depending on the vegetables and amount of ghee/oil used).
