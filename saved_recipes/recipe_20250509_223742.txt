2. Ingredients Needed:

* 500 gms Baby Potatoes (aloo), scrubbed clean, halved or quartered if large
* 2 large Onions, finely chopped
* 4-5 Green Chilies, finely chopped (adjust to your spice preference, add more for extra heat!)
* 1 inch Ginger, finely grated
* 2 cloves Garlic, finely minced
* 1 tsp Turmeric Powder
* 2 tsp Red Chili Powder (adjust to preference, use Kashmiri chili for color, Byadgi for heat)
* 1 tsp Coriander Powder
* 1 tsp Cumin Powder
* ½ tsp Garam Masala
* ¼ tsp Asafoetida (hing)
* 2 tbsp Ghee or Coconut Oil
* 1 cup Water or Vegetable Broth
* Salt to taste
* Fresh Coriander leaves, chopped (for garnish)
* 1 tbsp Kasuri Methi (dried fenugreek leaves) - optional, adds lovely aroma
* Juice of ½ Lime


3. Step-by-Step Instructions:

1. **Pressure Cook the Potatoes:** Pressure cook the potatoes with a little salt and water until tender but not mushy (approx. 2-3 whistles).
2. **Sauté Aromatics:** Heat ghee/oil in a pan. Add asafoetida and let it sizzle for a few seconds. Add onions and sauté until golden brown. Add green chilies, ginger, and garlic. Sauté for another minute until fragrant.
3. **Bloom Spices:** Add turmeric powder, red chili powder, coriander powder, and cumin powder. Sauté for 30 seconds, stirring continuously, to prevent burning.
4. **Add Potatoes:** Add the cooked potatoes to the pan and gently mix with the spices.
5. **Simmer & Thicken:** Add water or vegetable broth, salt, and Kasuri Methi (if using). Bring to a simmer, cover, and cook for 5-7 minutes, allowing the flavors to meld and the sauce to slightly thicken.
6. **Finishing Touches:** Stir in the lime juice. Garnish with fresh coriander leaves.
7. **Serve Hot:** Serve the Aloo Dum Inferno hot with roti, naan, or brown rice.
