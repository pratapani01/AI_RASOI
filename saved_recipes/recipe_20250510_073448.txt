1. Recipe Name:  Aadrak Mushroom Murgh (Ginger Chicken with Mushrooms)

2. Ingredients Needed:

* 250 gms boneless chicken breast, cut into 1-inch cubes
* 250 gms button mushrooms, halved or quartered if large
* 1 large onion, finely chopped
* 2 inches ginger, finely grated
* 2-3 green chilies, finely chopped (adjust to your spice preference)
* 1 tsp turmeric powder
* 1 tsp red chili powder (adjust to your spice preference)
* 1 tsp coriander powder
* ½ tsp cumin powder
* ½ tsp garam masala
* 2 tbsp oil or ghee
* Salt to taste
* Fresh cilantro, chopped (for garnish)
* 1 cup low-fat yogurt (optional, for a creamier texture)


3. Step-by-Step Instructions:

1. Marinate the chicken: In a bowl, combine the chicken cubes with ½ the grated ginger, 1 green chili (finely chopped), ½ tsp turmeric powder, ½ tsp red chili powder, salt, and a tablespoon of yogurt (if using). Mix well and let it marinate for at least 30 minutes.
2. Sauté aromatics: Heat oil/ghee in a pan or kadai. Add the chopped onions and sauté until golden brown. Add the remaining grated ginger and green chilies and sauté for another minute until fragrant.
3. Add spices: Add the turmeric powder, red chili powder, coriander powder, cumin powder, and salt. Sauté for 30 seconds until fragrant, ensuring the spices don't burn.
4. Cook the chicken: Add the marinated chicken to the pan and cook until it is browned on all sides.
5. Add mushrooms: Add the mushrooms to the pan and stir well. Cook for 5-7 minutes, until the mushrooms soften and release their moisture.
6. Simmer:  If using yogurt, add it now and stir gently. Add ½ cup of water and bring the mixture to a simmer. Cover the pan and cook for another 10-15 minutes, or until the chicken is cooked through and the gravy has thickened slightly.
7. Garnish and serve: Garnish with fresh cilantro and serve hot with roti, brown rice, or quinoa.
