1. Recipe Name:  Mushroom & Onion Pulao (North Indian Style)

2. Ingredients Needed:

* 1 cup Basmati rice
* 1 cup sliced mushrooms
* 1 medium onion, finely chopped
* 2 cloves garlic, minced
* 1 inch ginger, grated
* 1 green chili, finely chopped (adjust to preference)
* 1/2 tsp turmeric powder
* 1 tsp coriander powder
* 1/2 tsp cumin powder
* 1/4 tsp garam masala
* 2 tbsp ghee or oil
* Salt to taste
* Fresh coriander leaves, for garnish
* 2 cups water (adjust as needed for rice)


3. Step-by-Step Instructions:

1. Rinse the basmati rice thoroughly under cold water until the water runs clear. Soak for 15-20 minutes. This helps the rice cook evenly.
2. Heat ghee or oil in a deep pan or pot over medium heat. Add the chopped onions and sauté until golden brown.
3. Add the minced garlic and grated ginger. Sauté for another 30 seconds until fragrant.
4. Add the green chili and sauté for a few seconds. Be careful not to burn the chilies.
5. Add the sliced mushrooms and sauté until they soften and release their moisture (about 5-7 minutes).
6. Stir in the turmeric powder, coriander powder, cumin powder, and garam masala. Sauté for 30 seconds, ensuring the spices are fragrant and not burnt.
7. Add the soaked rice and salt. Mix well to coat the rice with the spices and oil.
8. Pour in 2 cups of water (adjust based on rice type and desired consistency). Bring the mixture to a boil.
9. Once boiling, reduce the heat to low, cover the pan with a tight-fitting lid, and simmer for 15-18 minutes, or until the rice is cooked and the water is absorbed.  Do not lift the lid during this time.
10. Fluff the rice gently with a fork. Garnish with fresh coriander leaves.
