2. Ingredients Needed:

* 200g boneless, skinless chicken breast, cut into cubes
* 2 large eggs
* 1 cup basmati rice
* 1/2 tsp tandoori masala
* 1/4 tsp turmeric powder
* 1/4 tsp red chili powder
* 1/4 tsp garam masala
* 1 tbsp lemon juice
* 1 tbsp Greek yogurt
* 1/2 tsp cumin seeds (jeera)
* 1 small onion, finely chopped
* 1/2 cup chopped cucumber
* 1/4 cup chopped tomatoes
* Fresh cilantro, chopped (for garnish)
* Salt to taste
* Olive oil or cooking spray

3. Step-by-Step Instructions:

* **Prepare the Chicken:** Marinate the chicken cubes with tandoori masala, turmeric powder, red chili powder, garam masala, lemon juice, yogurt, and salt for at least 30 minutes (longer is better).
* **Cook the Rice:** Rinse the basmati rice thoroughly.  Heat 1/2 tsp olive oil in a pan, add cumin seeds and let them splutter. Add the rice and sauté for a minute. Add 1 cup of water, salt, and bring to a boil. Reduce heat, cover, and simmer until the rice is cooked through (about 15-20 minutes).
* **Cook the Chicken:**  Preheat oven to 375°F (190°C).  Bake the marinated chicken for 20-25 minutes, or until cooked through. Alternatively, you can pan-fry or grill the chicken.
* **Prepare the Egg:**  Boil the eggs until hard-boiled (about 8-10 minutes). Peel and chop them.
* **Assemble the Salad:**  In a bowl, combine the cooked chicken, chopped hard-boiled eggs, chopped onion, cucumber, and tomatoes.  Garnish with fresh cilantro.
* **Serve:** Serve the healthy Tandoori Chicken Salad with the Jeera Rice.
