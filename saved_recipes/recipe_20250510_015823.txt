* 1 cup brown rice
* 1 cup chopped spinach
* 1 medium onion, finely chopped
* 2 cloves garlic, minced

* Fresh cilantro, chopped (for garnish)
* 2 cups water or chicken broth

3. Step-by-Step Instructions:

1. **Prepare the rice:** Rinse the brown rice under cold water until the water runs clear.  Cook the rice according to package directions, usually with a 2:1 water-to-rice ratio.
2. **Marinate the chicken:** In a bowl, combine the chicken cubes with yogurt, turmeric powder, coriander powder, cumin powder, half of the minced ginger-garlic paste, green chili, salt, and a pinch of saffron. Mix well and let it marinate for at least 30 minutes.
3. **Sauté the aromatics:** Heat olive oil in a pan or pot. Add the chopped onions and sauté until golden brown. Add the remaining ginger-garlic paste and sauté for another minute until fragrant.
4. **Cook the chicken:** Add the marinated chicken to the pan and cook until browned on all sides.
5. **Simmer:** Add 1 cup of water or chicken broth, bring to a simmer, cover, and cook until the chicken is cooked through (about 15-20 minutes).
6. **Add spinach:** Stir in the chopped spinach and cook until wilted (about 2-3 minutes).
7. **Combine and finish:** Gently stir in the cooked brown rice and garam masala.  Mix well to combine all the ingredients. Simmer for another 2-3 minutes to allow the flavors to meld. Garnish with fresh cilantro and remaining saffron strands.
