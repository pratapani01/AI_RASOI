Recipe:
1. Recipe Name:  Masala Oats with Coffee-Spiced Milk

2. Ingredients Needed:

* 1/2 cup Rolled Oats
* 1 cup Milk (low-fat or skimmed)
* 1 tbsp Coffee Powder (instant or freshly brewed, strong)
* 1 tsp Hershey's Cocoa Powder (unsweetened, for a richer flavour, optional)
* 1/4 tsp Cinnamon Powder
* Pinch of Nutmeg Powder
* 1/4 tsp Cardamom Powder (Elaichi)
* 1-2 tsp Honey or Jaggery (to taste, replace sugar)
* 1/4 cup chopped Almonds or Cashews (optional, for added protein and healthy fats)
* 1 tbsp Ghee or Coconut Oil (for sautéing)

3. Step-by-Step Instructions:

1. Heat ghee or coconut oil in a small pan over medium heat. Add chopped almonds/cashews (if using) and sauté for a minute until lightly browned. Remove from pan and set aside.
2. In the same pan, add the rolled oats and dry roast for 2-3 minutes until fragrant. This enhances their flavour.
3. Add milk to the pan and bring to a simmer.  
4. Stir in coffee powder, cocoa powder (if using), cinnamon, nutmeg, and cardamom powder. Mix well.
5. Reduce heat to low and let the oats simmer for 5-7 minutes, or until the oats are cooked and the liquid is absorbed. Stir occasionally to prevent sticking.
6. Remove from heat and stir in honey or jaggery to taste. 
7. Garnish with the roasted nuts.  Serve warm.


4. Estimated Calories: Approximately 300-350 calories (depending on the type of milk and nuts used).

5. Cuisine Type: North Indian Fusion (combines traditional spices with a Western breakfast staple)

6. Dietary Info:  Can be adapted for vegetarian, vegan (replace milk with plant-based milk, ghee with oil), and low-sugar diets (reduce or eliminate honey/jaggery).  Contains gluten (from oats).

7. Recommended Meals for the Day:

* **Breakfast:**  A light fruit salad or a small bowl of yogurt.
* **Lunch:** Masala Oats with Coffee-Spiced Milk (this recipe)
* **Dinner:**  A light vegetable curry with roti or brown rice.  Avoid heavy, oily foods in the evening.  

**Note:** This recipe provides a healthy twist to a typically less healthy combination.  Adjust the amount of honey/jaggery according to your preference and dietary needs. Using unsweetened cocoa powder is key to maintaining a healthier calorie count.  Freshly ground spices are always preferable for enhanced flavour and aroma.
