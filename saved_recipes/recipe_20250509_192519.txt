* **For the Coffee Milk:**
    * 1 cup milk (low-fat or skimmed)
    * 1 tsp strong brewed coffee (filter or instant)
    * Pinch of saffron strands
    * 1/4 tsp cardamom powder
    * 1 tbsp jaggery or honey (optional, for sweetness)
* **For the Besan Chilla:**
    * 1/2 cup besan (gram flour)
    * 1/4 cup water
    * 1/4 tsp turmeric powder
    * 1/4 tsp red chili powder (adjust to taste)
    * 1/4 tsp cumin seeds
    * A pinch of asafoetida (hing)
    * 1/4 tsp chopped cilantro
    * Salt to taste
    * 1 tbsp oil or ghee for cooking


3. Step-by-Step Instructions:

* **Coffee Milk:** Gently heat the milk in a small saucepan. Add saffron strands and let them infuse for a few minutes.  Add brewed coffee and cardamom powder. Stir well and simmer for 2-3 minutes.  Remove from heat and add jaggery/honey if desired.
* **Besan Chilla:** In a bowl, whisk together besan, water, turmeric powder, red chili powder, cumin seeds, asafoetida, cilantro, and salt until a smooth batter forms (slightly thicker than pancake batter).
* Heat a non-stick pan or tawa over medium heat. Add a little oil or ghee. Pour a ladleful of the besan batter onto the hot pan and spread it thinly into a small circle.
* Cook for 1-2 minutes per side, or until golden brown and cooked through.  Repeat with the remaining batter.
