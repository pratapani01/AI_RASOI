1. Recipe Name:  Saffron-infused Chicken & Brown Rice with Methi (Fenugreek) Vegetables

2. Ingredients Needed:

* 250g boneless, skinless chicken breast, cut into 1-inch cubes
* 1 cup brown rice
* 1 cup chopped mixed vegetables (carrots, peas, beans, cauliflower) – feel free to add more variety based on your preference.
* 1 tbsp ginger-garlic paste
* 1 tsp turmeric powder
* 1 tsp red chili powder (adjust to your spice preference)
* ½ tsp coriander powder
* ½ tsp cumin powder
* ¼ tsp garam masala
* ¼ tsp methi (fenugreek) powder
* 2 strands saffron, crushed
* 2 tbsp chopped fresh cilantro
* 2 tbsp plain yogurt
* 1 tbsp olive oil or ghee
* Salt to taste
* Water as needed


3. Step-by-Step Instructions:

1. **Prepare the Rice:** Rinse the brown rice thoroughly under cold water. In a saucepan, combine the rice with 2 cups of water. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer for 40-45 minutes, or until the rice is cooked through and the water is absorbed.
2. **Marinate the Chicken:** In a bowl, combine the chicken cubes with yogurt, ginger-garlic paste, turmeric powder, red chili powder, coriander powder, cumin powder, methi powder, salt, and half of the crushed saffron. Mix well and let it marinate for at least 30 minutes.
3. **Sauté the Vegetables:** Heat olive oil or ghee in a pan. Add the chopped vegetables and sauté for 5-7 minutes until slightly softened. Set aside.
4. **Cook the Chicken:** In the same pan, add the marinated chicken and cook over medium heat until browned and cooked through (about 10-12 minutes), stirring occasionally.
5. **Combine and Simmer:** Add the sautéed vegetables and the remaining crushed saffron to the cooked chicken. Stir well to combine. Add a little water if needed to create a light sauce. Simmer for another 5 minutes to allow the flavors to meld.
6. **Serve:** Garnish with fresh cilantro and serve hot with the cooked brown rice.
