3. Step-by-Step Instructions:

1. **Marinate Chicken:** In a bowl, combine the chicken cubes with yogurt, ginger-garlic paste, green chilies, turmeric powder, coriander powder, cumin powder, red chili powder, salt, and half of the chopped mint and coriander. Marinate for at least 30 minutes (longer is better).
2. **Sauté Onions:** Heat oil/ghee in a large pot or biryani pot. Add the chopped onions and sauté until golden brown.
3. **Add Spices:** Add the remaining mint and coriander to the sautéed onions. Stir in the garam masala and cook for 30 seconds.
4. **Add Chicken:** Add the marinated chicken to the pot and cook until browned on all sides.
5. **Add Rice and Water:** Gently stir in the soaked basmati rice (and optional brown rice). Add enough water (approximately 3-3.5 cups) to cook the rice, ensuring the water level is about 1 inch above the rice.  Add saffron (if using).
6. **Simmer:** Bring the mixture to a boil, then reduce heat to low, cover the pot tightly, and simmer for 15-20 minutes, or until the rice is cooked and the water is absorbed.  Do not stir during simmering.
7. **Rest:** Once cooked, turn off the heat and let the biryani rest for 10 minutes before fluffing it gently with a fork.

4. Estimated Calories: Approximately 350-400 calories per serving (depending on portion size and oil/ghee used).

5. Cuisine Type: North Indian

6. Dietary Info:  Can be adapted for a low-fat diet by reducing oil/ghee and using skinless chicken.  Contains gluten if using wheat-based biryani. This recipe can be easily modified for vegetarian preference by using paneer instead of chicken.

7. Recommended Meals for the Day:

* **Breakfast:**  Oats with fruits and nuts or a light vegetable omelet.
* **Lunch:** Healthy Chicken Biryani (this recipe)
* **Dinner:**  A light salad with grilled fish or vegetables.  Avoid heavy carbohydrates at night.
* **Snacks:** Fruits, yogurt, or a handful of nuts.


**Note:**  Adjust the amount of spices to your preference.  For a healthier version, you can use less oil and more vegetables like carrots and peas.  Soaking the rice is crucial for fluffy biryani.
