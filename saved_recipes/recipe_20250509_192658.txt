* 1 inch Ginger, finely grated
* 2-3 cloves Garlic, finely minced
* 1 tsp Red Chili Powder (Kashmiri for color, add more for extra heat)
* 1 tsp Coriander Powder
* ½ tsp Turmeric Powder
* ½ tsp Garam Masala
* ¼ tsp  Amchur Powder (dried mango powder, for tanginess)

3. Step-by-Step Instructions:

1. Heat oil/ghee in a wok or deep pan. Add onions and sauté until golden brown.
2. Add green chilies, ginger, and garlic. Sauté for another minute until fragrant.
3. Add red chili powder, coriander powder, turmeric powder, and garam masala. Sauté for 30 seconds, stirring constantly to prevent burning.
